# 42_Common_Core_Projects

Course 42 begins with a common core. This first part of the course is identical for all Campus 42. The projects are done in C language: it is the one which allows you to understand all the basics of programming and which teaches you to adapt to any other language more late.

The common core is structured around various projects which will provide a broad overview of what we can do with programming: graphics (2D AND 3D), network, classification, C++, etc.
